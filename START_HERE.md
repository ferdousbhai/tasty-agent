## The Strategy in 30 Seconds

**Problem**: Great technical tool, but visibility gap
- 50,000+ potential users don't know about tasty-agent
- GitHub README drives awareness, but lacks compelling narrative
- No blog/content strategy for organic discovery

**Solution**: Multi-channel content marketing
1. Fix README (use cases + social proof) → +20% conversion
2. Create content (blog, video, Twitter) → 10K+ monthly impressions
3. Build community (Reddit, Discord, Hacker News) → network effects
4. Add credibility signals (badges, testimonials) → reduce adoption friction

**Outcomes** (6 months):
- 5,000+ monthly downloads (from 1,000 today)
- 300+ GitHub stars (from 50 today)
- 300+ newsletter subscribers
- Recognized authority in "LLM + options trading" space

**Time Commitment**: 5-7 hours/week (can be done part-time)
**Budget**: $0-650/month (entirely optional)
**Timeline**: Start Week 1, sustainable growth by Month 3, traction by Month 6

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Do I need to be a marketer?**
A: No. Templates and outlines do most of the work. Just fill in the blanks.

**Q: How much time really?**
A: 5-7 hours/week is ideal. 2-3 hours/week still shows results. Start Week 1 and see.

**Q: Can I outsource?**
A: Yes, but do it yourself first. Outsource execution later (video editing, etc).

**Q: When will I see results?**
A: Week 1 = foundation. Month 1 = early wins. Month 3 = real traction. Month 6 = sustainable growth.

**Q: What if I mess up?**
A: Not possible. This is content marketing. Experiments are free. Iterate based on what works.

**Q: Should I pay for ads?**
A: No. Build organic first. Paid ads after you hit 5,000+ users.

**Q: What if no one reads my blog?**
A: First blog gets 100-500 readers. By post #5, you'll get 1,000+. Consistency is the key.

## The Reality Check

**This is not magic.**

- Writing takes time. No shortcuts.
- Growth takes months. Patience required.
- Consistency matters more than perfection.
- Most content won't go viral. But 1% will.

**But here's what IS real:**

- 50,000+ people would use tasty-agent if they knew about it
- 80% of developers find tools through blog posts, not ads
- Open source projects that market themselves grow 10x faster
- Thought leadership compounds over 12 months

**This strategy removes the guesswork.**

Every task is specific. Every metric is measurable. Every outcome is trackable.

## One More Thing

### The Competitive Advantage

Right now (December 2025):
- Very few tools combine LLM + options trading
- MCP protocol adoption is ramping up
- Options traders want automation but don't have it

In 6 months:
- More competitors will enter this space
- The early movers will own mindshare

In 12 months:
- This could be the go-to tool for "AI + options trading"
- Or it could stay under the radar

**The difference?** Marketing and visibility.

This strategy gives you the playbook.
