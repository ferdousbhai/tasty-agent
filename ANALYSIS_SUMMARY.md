## FINAL THOUGHTS

**tasty-agent has exceptional potential** because it solves a real problem (options trading automation + LLM integration) for a growing audience (AI developers + options traders).

The technical foundation is solid. Now the focus shifts to **visibility and adoption**.

This is not a product problem. This is a **marketing and discovery problem**.

With consistent execution of the strategies outlined above:
- 6 months: Recognized tool in the niche
- 12 months: Go-to solution for options trading + LLMs
- 24 months: Potential acquisition target or community-funded project

**Success factors**:
1. Consistent content creation (this is the bottleneck)
2. Authentic community engagement (not sales-pitch driven)
3. Focus on user value (help first, promote second)
4. Patience and persistence (growth takes 6-12 months)
5. Data-driven iteration (measure, analyze, optimize)

The detailed strategy documents provide everything needed to execute.

**Pick one thing from the 30-day plan and start today.**
